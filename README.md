## Web Service on Flask for Wine Quality Prediction

### Project Overview
This is a university project featuring a local web service where users can input wine characteristics and receive quality predictions. The predictive model is trained using the [Wine Quality dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality).

### Technologies Used
* **Python** - programming language
* **Flask** - web framework
* **RandomForestClassifier** - machine learning model for predictions

### Development Prospects
* Integration of additional machine learning models for comparison
* Implementation of data visualization features
* Addition of user authentication system
* Deployment on cloud platforms

### Quick Start Guide
1. Run the `app.py` file
2. Access the provided link from the console
3. Input wine characteristics in the form
4. Click the **Predict** button to get results

### Requirements
* **Python 3.x** - ensure Python is installed on your system
* **Flask** - web framework for building the application
* **Scikit-learn** - for machine learning model
* **Pandas** - for data processing
* **Numpy** - for numerical operations

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
